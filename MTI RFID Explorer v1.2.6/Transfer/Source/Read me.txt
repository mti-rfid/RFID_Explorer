1.	BOOL  API_Open(UINT uiPID, UINT uiVID);
2.	BOOL API_Serial_Open(TCHAR *tcComPort, DCB &r_Dcb);
	=>Choice one device to open

2.	void   API_Close();

3.	UINT  API_Read(UCHAR *cData, UINT iLength = USB_LENGTH);
	=>If returned 0, it means doesn't receive any data.

4.	BOOL API_Write(UCHAR *cData, UINT iLength = USB_LENGTH);

5.	UINT  API_AskRevCount();
	=>Use this function to detect what number data is input. 
	  If the device is USB, only returned max report count.
	  If it is the serial, returned input data count.

6.	char* API_AskDevType();
	=>Ask device that is USB or RS232.

7.	BOOL API_ClearBuffer();
        =>Clear RS232 input/output buffer and clear error state.

2.  Write data to device
     API_Write()   //Write Data

3. Read data from device
